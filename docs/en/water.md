# Water

The water house is equipped with the following facilities: a wash basin, a shower, a kitchen sink, and a dishwasher. Water can be brought from the nearby firehouse.

To ensure you have hot water, please turn on the water heater upon arrival.

!> Attention: We will inform you in advance about the period of your stay — in winter, you will need to carry water, while in summer, you can use the large tank under the house.

## 1. Access to Water

- Water for the house is located in the firehouse.

- The house is unlocked with a key that hangs above the door.

- After use, be sure to return the key to its place so other guests can have free access to the water.

## 2. Winter Period (Carry Water)

- In winter, you need to carry water yourself, using the tanks located in the hallway and in the toilet room.

- Pour the carried water into the tank in front of the bathroom, which has a capacity of 60 liters. (photo of the tank)

- The tanks come in different sizes: 10, 20, and 30 liters. Choose the one that is most convenient for you to carry.

- We recommend transporting the larger tanks by car.

## 3. Summer Period (Large Tank Under the House)

- In the summer, a large tank located under the house is available.

- Regularly check the water level in the large tank to ensure you don’t run out of water.

- To fill it, use the hose:

  - Connect one end of the hose in the firehouse, and the other end to the tank.

  - Press the hose in the tank using the lid to prevent it from falling out accidentally.

  - Filling the tank takes time. Monitor the water level and do not leave the water running when you leave the house.

  - It is recommended to fill no more than half of the tank at a time, to avoid overloading the pump in the firehouse. If necessary, the tank can be fully filled over two separate days.

- After filling the large tank, add chlorine to prevent bacteria growth. The chlorine is located in the small room behind the bathroom. Dosage: 1 cap of the bottle per full tank.

## 4. Drinking Water Quality

- The water from the firehouse is drinkable.

- We recommend bringing separate drinking water, even in the summer. You can use a special canister with a tap for this.

!> Do not use the tap water in the kitchen or bathroom, as it passes through the house pump or may contain chlorine from the large tank.

## 5. Using the Dishwasher

- Before using the dishwasher, make sure the house tank is at least half full (30 liters), as sometimes extra water is needed for handwashing or filling pots.

## 6. General Recommendations

- The pump in the house should not run dry — there must always be water in the tank.

- The shower is water-efficient, but keep in mind that one person can use up to half of the water in the house tank per shower. If you shower quickly, less water will be used.
