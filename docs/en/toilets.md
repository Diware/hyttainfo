# Toilets

We have installed two different toilets from the Norwegian company Cinderella. To avoid confusion, please carefully read the information below:

## 1. Urinal Toilet

- **Purpose:**  
  This toilet is intended exclusively for urination. It has clear markings and a special image inside the lid confirming its purpose.

- **Recommendation:**  
  Before use, make sure to pay attention to the markings to avoid using it for other purposes.

## 2. Toilet for All Other Needs

!> This toilet cannot be used without electricity!  
  It is also recommended not to use the toilet more than 4 times per hour (once every 15 minutes).

- **Preparation for Use:**  

  - Before use, place a special bag in the toilet, just like setting a paper filter in a coffee maker.

  - Important: The bag should not be placed in the toilet beforehand – it should be set right before use.

  - The bags are located on the wall next to the toilet, and an extra box with bags is located on the shelves opposite the bathroom.

- **After Use:**  

  - Close the toilet lid.

  - Wait about 2 seconds for the device to "register" that the lid is closed.

  !> Important: Opening the lid immediately after pressing the button can cause a fire and fire hazard!

  - Press the button, after which you will hear the characteristic mechanical sounds of the device in operation.

  - If the mechanism doesn’t work, press the button again.

  - After pressing the button, wait 5-10 seconds before opening the lid. This is necessary for the toilet to safely "take" the bag with all its contents.

  !> Note: The button doesn’t work if the lid is open, the toilet needs about 2 seconds to confirm that the lid is closed.

  - Open the lid and make sure the bag is gone.

  - If it turns out that the bag hasn’t disappeared or got stuck halfway, close the lid and press the button again. This rarely happens, but repeating the procedure 2–3 times usually solves the problem.

  - Sometimes 1–2 centimeters of the bag remain. In this case, repeat the procedure with the button once more – in most cases, the toilet will clear this small remainder.

  !> If the bag is almost empty, it is recommended to add one or two glasses of water for proper burning. A glass for this purpose is specially placed on the windowsill in the toilet – it’s there for your convenience, so you don’t have to look for another one. Adding water ensures enough weight to the bag, which helps the device to burn it correctly.

## 3. Instructions for Children

- If you have children, explain which toilet is for urination and which is for other needs, to avoid confusion.

## 4. General Recommendations

- Carefully follow the instructions placed on the toilets.

- If the device doesn’t behave as described (for example, the bag doesn’t disappear after pressing the button), try repeating the procedure or contact the service personnel.

- Follow safety precautions and be mindful of safety, especially regarding the waiting time after pressing the button, to prevent fire hazards.
